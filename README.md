# Bank-Churn-Analysis

# Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical challenge for banks, as acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. The bank is experiencing customer attrition and wants to understand why customers are leaving. Using historical customer data, this project aims to analyze customer demographics, financial behavior, and engagement patterns to identify the key factors contributing to churn.

# Project Goal

The goal of this project is to:

Analyze customer churn patterns using Python and Pandas

Identify key drivers influencing customer attrition

Segment customers based on demographics and behavior

Provide data-driven insights to help the bank improve customer retention strategies

# Key Insights

Inactive customers show a significantly higher churn rate compared to active members.

Older customers (50+ age group) are more likely to churn than younger customers.

Customers with lower credit scores have a higher tendency to leave the bank.

Germany has the highest churn rate among all regions, indicating possible regional issues.

Customers with fewer products (especially one product) churn more frequently.

Customers without a credit card show slightly higher churn compared to those with one.

Churn is highest among new customers with low tenure, and decreases as tenure increases.

# Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the bank should consider the following actions:

Focus retention efforts on inactive customers, especially those with low engagement.

Design targeted loyalty programs for older customers to reduce age-related churn.

Improve onboarding and early engagement for new customers to reduce early-stage churn.

Introduce bundled product offers to encourage customers to use multiple bank products.

Provide personalized financial support or advisory services to customers with low credit scores.

Conduct a deeper investigation into region-specific churn drivers in Germany.
